1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your environment variables (see `.env.example`)
5. Run database migrations: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
6. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## üìã Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/your-feature-name` - Individual features
- `hotfix/issue-description` - Critical bug fixes
- `release/version-number` - Release preparation

### Making Changes
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Submit a pull request

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new HR analytics feature`
- `fix: resolve CV parsing issue`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `test: add unit tests for skills matching`
- `refactor: improve database query performance`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
