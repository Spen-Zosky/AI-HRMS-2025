## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AI-HRMS-2025 seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: [spen.zosky@gmail.com](mailto:spen.zosky@gmail.com)
3. Include "SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the subject line
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA) support
- Session management and timeout

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (ORM-based queries)

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration
- Helmet.js security headers
- Request size limits
- API key authentication for external services

### Infrastructure Security
- Environment variable protection
- Secrets management
- Database access controls
- Logging and audit trails
- Error handling (no sensitive data exposure)

### Compliance
- GDPR-ready data handling
- EU AI Act compliant
- SOC 2 Type II preparation
- Regular security assessments

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication checks

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Review dependency licenses
- Monitor for security advisories
- Use lock files (package-lock.json)

### Development Environment
- Use strong passwords
- Enable 2FA on GitHub account
- Keep development tools updated
- Use secure network connections
- Don't share development credentials

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Container security scanning
- Infrastructure as Code security

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
- Code review for security issues
- Authentication bypass testing
- Authorization testing
- Input validation testing

## Incident Response

### In Case of a Security Incident
1. **Immediate containment**
2. **Assessment of impact**
3. **Communication to stakeholders**
4. **Evidence preservation**
5. **Remediation and recovery**
6. **Post-incident analysis**

### Communication Plan
- Internal team notification
- User notification (if applicable)
- Regulatory reporting (if required)
- Public disclosure (responsible disclosure)

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings
```javascript
// Helmet.js security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));

// Rate limiting
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security environment variables
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
```
