# AI-HRMS-2025 Development Workflow

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Specification Phase
- Create detailed feature specification using templates
- Define acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
- Identify security and compliance requirements
- Review with stakeholders and obtain approval

### 2. Design Phase
- Database schema changes (if needed) with migration strategy
- API endpoint design with OpenAPI specification
- UI/UX mockups with accessibility considerations
- Security impact assessment and threat modeling

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage
- Code implementation following constitution standards
- Integration testing with existing HRMS components
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment

### 4. Review Phase
- Code review with security and performance focus
- Database migration review and rollback testing
- Documentation review for completeness and accuracy
- Stakeholder approval for user-facing changes

### 5. Deployment Phase
- Staging environment testing with production-like data
- Production deployment with monitoring and alerting
- Post-deployment monitoring and validation
- Rollback procedures documented and tested

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Requirements
- ESLint/Prettier compliance (zero warnings)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Jest test coverage >90% for new code
- No high or critical security vulnerabilities

### Database Quality Requirements
- Migration rollback testing completed successfully
- Performance impact assessment (query execution time)
- Data integrity validation with referential constraints
- Backup verification and restore testing

### Security Quality Requirements
- Authentication/authorization testing completed
- Input validation and sanitization verified
- Audit trail validation for all data modifications
- Compliance checklist completion (GDPR, SOX)

### Documentation Quality Requirements
- API documentation updated and validated
- User guide updates for user-facing changes
- Technical documentation for architectural changes
- Security documentation for security-related changes

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branch Protection
- Requires PR approval from designated reviewers
- All CI/CD checks must pass before merge
- No direct commits to main branch allowed
- Automatic deployment to staging environment

### Feature Branch Workflow
- Feature branches created from main
- Branch naming: feature/JIRA-123-feature-description
- Regular rebasing to keep branches current
- Clean commit history before PR submission

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on PR creation
- Security scans run on code changes
- Performance tests run on database changes

### Code Quality Checks
- Automated linting and formatting validation
- TypeScript compilation verification
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code coverage reporting and enforcement

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
- Create hotfix branch from main
- Minimal changes for critical issue resolution
- Expedited review process with security focus
- Immediate deployment with monitoring

### Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback triggers for critical failures
- Database rollback procedures documented
- Communication plan for user notification
- Post-incident review and documentation
