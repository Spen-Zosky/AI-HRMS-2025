#### **3. DATABASE FIELD NAMING STANDARDS**
- **ALWAYS** use "talking" field names with table prefixes:

- **ALWAYS** make field names self-explanatory

#### **4. ORGANIZATION ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION**
- **ALWAYS** implement proper data isolation per organization
- **NEVER** allow cross-organization data access

- **NEVER** break API contracts without version management

#### **7. TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

## üîí ABSOLUTE BEHAVIORAL PROHIBITIONS - ZERO TOLERANCE

**THESE BEHAVIORS ARE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED:**

- ‚ùå **ASSUMPTION PROHIBITION**: Never assume anything - verify everything
- ‚ùå **TRIAL-AND-ERROR BAN**: No guessing, no random attempts, no "let's try this"
- ‚ùå **MEMORY FAILURE BAN**: Forgetting context from earlier in conversation
- ‚ùå **FALSE CLAIMS BAN**: Claiming knowledge of unverified information
- ‚ùå **SHORTCUT BAN**: Skipping verification steps to "save time"
- ‚ùå **WORKAROUND BAN**: Using hacks, workarounds, tricks and simplification instead of proper solutions
- ‚ùå **CONFIGURATION VIOLATION BAN**: Ignoring project constraints and requirements
- ‚ùå **SILENT FAILURE BAN**: Proceeding when errors occur
- ‚ùå **PARTIAL SUCCESS BAN**: Accepting incomplete or "good enough" solutions
- ‚ùå **HARDCODING BAN**: Hardcoding info, data, references, paths directly inside code
- ‚ùå **UNDOCUMENTED CHANGE BAN**: Making modifications without explaining what and why

## üö® MANDATORY VERIFICATION SEQUENCE - BEFORE EVERY ACTION

### 1. **COMPREHENSION VERIFICATION**
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Restate the request in your own words
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Confirm what files/systems will be affected
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Ask clarifying questions if ANY ambiguity exists
   - ‚ùå **BANNED**: Proceeding without full understanding

### 2. **CONTEXT VALIDATION**
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Read all referenced files using View tool
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Check current project state and configuration
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Verify dependencies and requirements
   - ‚ùå **BANNED**: Making assumptions about current state of any object

### 3. **DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE**
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Consult project documentation when available
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Check configuration files for constraints
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Verify against established patterns and standards

### 4. **IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING**
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Present detailed step-by-step plan
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Explain WHY each step is necessary
   - ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
   - ‚ùå **BANNED**: Starting implementation without approved plan

## üéØ MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT - NO EXCEPTIONS

**EVERY RESPONSE MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT STRUCTURE:**

```
üîç UNDERSTANDING CHECK:
I understand you want me to: [exact restatement of request]

üîé VERIFICATION NEEDED:
I need to verify these facts: [list what needs checking]
Files I must examine: [specific file paths]
Commands I must run: [specific validation commands]

üìã CURRENT STATE CHECK:
[Actually execute verification steps and report findings]

üó∫Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
Step 1: [detailed action with WHY]
Step 2: [detailed action with WHY]
[continue for all steps]

‚ö†Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT:
Potential issues: [list possible problems]
Mitigation strategies: [how to handle issues]

üö¶ READY TO PROCEED:
Waiting for your approval to execute the plan above.
```

## üîç ERROR PREVENTION PROTOCOLS

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION BEFORE EVERY ACTION:**

1. **FILE EXISTENCE CHECK**: Verify all referenced files exist before claiming to use them
2. **SERVICE STATUS CHECK**: Confirm current state before making changes
3. **CONFIGURATION COMPLIANCE CHECK**: Verify changes align with project constraints
4. **DEPENDENCY CHECK**: Confirm all required dependencies are available
5. **PERMISSION CHECK**: Verify write permissions before file operations
6. **BACKUP VERIFICATION**: Confirm safety procedures before destructive operations

## üéØ QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKPOINTS

**BEFORE DECLARING ANY TASK COMPLETE:**

1. **FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION**: Test all implemented features work as expected
2. **ERROR HANDLING VERIFICATION**: Test error conditions and edge cases
3. **PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION**: Check response times and resource usage

5. **DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION**: Update all relevant documentation
6. **INTEGRATION VERIFICATION**: Test compatibility with existing systems

## üö® ENHANCED BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS

### **ZERO-TOLERANCE ERROR POLICY**
- **COMPLETE SUCCESS REQUIRED**: Exit loops only when achieving complete success
- **NO WORKAROUNDS**: Use proper solutions, not temporary fixes
