# AI-HRMS-2025 Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Security First
- All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Multi-factor authentication required for admin operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR and SOX compliance mandatory

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Complete data isolation between organizations
- Scalable tenant onboarding process
- Centralized configuration with tenant-specific customization
- Performance optimization across all tenants

### 3. User Experience Excellence
- Intuitive interfaces for HR professionals
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Real-time feedback and status updates

### 4. Data Integrity
- Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
- Database referential integrity
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- Version control for all configuration changes

### 5. Development Standards
- Test-driven development with >90% coverage
- Code review requirements for all changes
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation-first approach

## Technical Standards

### Database Design
- Use "talking names" for all fields (user_, emp_, org_ prefixes)
- Implement soft deletes for audit compliance
- Index strategy for performance optimization
- Regular maintenance and cleanup procedures

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API versioning strategy

### Security Implementation
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular dependency updates and security patches

### Code Quality
- ESLint/Prettier compliance for consistent formatting
- TypeScript strict mode where applicable
- Comprehensive Jest test coverage
- Security-focused code reviews

### Documentation Requirements
- All APIs must have OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Database schema changes require migration documentation
- User-facing features require user guide updates
- Security changes require security impact assessment
