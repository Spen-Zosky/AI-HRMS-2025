## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

La gestione moderna delle competenze richiede un approccio sistematicamente strutturato che superi le tradizionali descrizioni di ruolo per abbracciare tassonomie granulari, dinamiche e standardizzate. Questo documento fornisce un framework completo per la classificazione, valutazione e gestione delle competenze basato sui principali standard internazionali e le migliori pratiche emergenti.

**Key Insights:**
- 85 milioni di lavori saranno sostituiti e 97 milioni creati entro il 2025
- 39% delle competenze chiave cambieranno entro il 2030 (WEF 2025)
- Il 87% delle aziende affronta skill gaps significativi
- ROI del 46% nella riduzione del turnover con skills mapping efficace

```

**ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS GAP:**
```
Team_Gap = Σ(Individual_Gap × Role_Criticality) / Team_Size

Organizational_Gap = Σ(Team_Gap × Team_Strategic_Importance) / Total_Teams

Skills_Risk_Score = (Gap_Size × Business_Impact × Time_to_Develop) / Market_Availability
