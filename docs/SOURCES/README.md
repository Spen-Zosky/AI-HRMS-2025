## üéØ Key Architecture Principles

### Database Architecture (MANDATORY)
- **Field Naming**: All database fields MUST use table prefixes (`user_*`, `emp_*`, `org_*`)
- **Multi-Tenant Scoping**: All operations MUST include organization isolation (`org_id`)
- **Model Location**: Database models located at `/models/` (root level, NOT `src/models/`)

### AI Services Integration
- **Graceful Degradation**: All AI services have fallback mechanisms
- **Provider Factory**: Dynamic selection between OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- **90%+ CV Parsing Accuracy**: Advanced NER and skills extraction
- **Vector Search**: Qdrant integration for semantic matching

### Security and Compliance
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with role-based access
- **Organization Isolation**: Complete multi-tenant data separation
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy by design with audit trails
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, validation, and monitoring

### Performance and Scalability
- **Async Processing**: Queue-based workflows with Redis Bull
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching for optimal performance
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query patterns
- **File Processing**: Efficient upload and AI-powered parsing

## üìä System Metrics and Capabilities

### Scale and Performance
- **39+ Enterprise Tables** with complete audit trails

- **1,728 Multilingual Translations** (EN/IT/FR/ES)
- **80 Job Roles** across 6 industries
- **2,419 Role-Skill Proficiency Mappings**

### AI Integration Capabilities
- **90%+ CV Parsing Accuracy** with multiple format support
- **85%+ Skills Matching Precision** for candidate evaluation
- **Multi-Provider Support** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- **Semantic Search** with vector database integration

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
